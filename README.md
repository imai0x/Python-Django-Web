# Coding Dojo Python
Welcome to Coding Dojo's Python Cohort for September 2016

Probably the easiest workflow for you is to:
 1. Make sure you have git installed
 2. Create your own, free, [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, if you don't have one already.
 2. Unless you have a particular affinity for the terminal, get a UI like [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), thank me later (or buy me lunch).
 3. [Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) **this** repository to your own GitHub account.
 4. When you log into your own github account, you should see the forked copy of this repo. Clone **that** copy, located on your github account, onto your local machine.
 5. From inside SourcTree, add the original repository (THIS one you're on right now owned by me) as a remote repo.

## Getting Started

On your computer, you should see your cloned version of the repo. Open it up and create a new folder called 'Lastname_FirstName', of course replacing it with your actual name. I'll show you all how to do this in class. Create two additional folders inside of it, 'Algorithms', and 'Assignments'.

In any organization, there will be a person responsible for merging the changes made by developers into the master repo. That's what I'll do. I'll ensure the changes I accept don't break the repo or cause errors to everyone.

Your job is to *make* changes (only in your personal folder!) and then to send them to me as Pull Requests. If you need a git refresher, check out the [learning platform](http://learn.codingdojo.com/m/2/3028/16879). Of particular interest, I want you to break right now and **re-read** the sections on [branching](http://learn.codingdojo.com/m/2/3028/16905) and [forking](http://learn.codingdojo.com/m/2/3028/16898), since these sections describes the process YOU will be using.

## Work-Flow ##

I suggest you work on your projects as you have been doing, in some random folder on your computer. Whenever you are ready to submit code to me, and you should be submitting code to me at least once **every day** for the next month (if not more frequently), do the following:

 * Open SourceTree
 * Make sure you select the master branch
 * Fetch / Pull any changes from your remote branch
 * Create a new branch names YourName_HHMM (hours, minutes, no spaces or crazy characters)
 * Copy the files you altered / created from the folder you were working within, into the copy of your local repo on your computer.
 * Commit the changes.
 * Push the changes (your new branch) up to your github
 * Navigate to GitHub in your browser + select the name of the branch you just created
 * Click on New Pull request and send the branch to me as a pull request

I will accept and comment on your code changes daily.

As mentioned, **Every.Single.Damn.Day** I want you to commit your class assignments so I can keep track your _daily_ progress. Also after doing the morning algorithms during the week, type up your assignment into the example JS HTML page I've provided and submit that too. You need to be programming _every day_ to become a developer.

At the Dojo, we only cover git for a portion of a day during Web Fundamentals (which most of you slept through =). When you graduate, you need to know how to use it comfortably and proficiently, otherwise you'll be the laughing stock of the town. You will be a version-control master by the end of this course because we'll use this repository to submit and review assignments. You can track the schedule and solutions in the [Assignment Calendar](https://github.com/authman/Python201609/blob/master/Apatira_Authman/New%20Schedule.pdf) as soon as I get it up. Likewise, the algorithm challenges you'll be expected to complete can be found in the Algorithms Calendar.

The second reason we're starting this is because that I like GitHub's social aspect, which will allow me to add comments into your code, have you correct your code, keep source control so you can see the evolution of your own progress, and again--get very familiar with pull requests, pushing, and merge conflict errors.
